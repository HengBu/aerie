-thread safety for MFS mutable directory inode
-concurrent namespace operations (mkdir, rmdir, link, unlink, rename)
-generic namemap: to be used by directory inodes and mount point pseudo-inodes
  - parameterized using a hashfunction (functor)
  - extend the hashtable interface to take the result of the hash-function as a hint 
    and verify that the hash is correct. is it cheaper to verify?
-readdir
-factories and storage manager for persistent objects
-factories for volatile objects
-files
-journal

================
-factory for superblock 
   - create superblock given a persistent superblock
-factory for inodes 
   - create inodes given a persistent inode


factories for persistent structures
 - to be used by the storage manager so we need a common interface
   to the structures. 
 - structures also need to use the same smgr interface to construct 
   instances.
