OSD layer 
---------
client side: we would like to support multiple file systems as a client might simultaneously want to mount multiple filesystems.
currently the osd layer does not support multiple file systems: we need to fix initialization of the lock managers, storage pool to be done when we open/load the storage system

====

we need a session manager in the IPC layer. 
Session structure is organized using inheritance:
IpcSession <- DpoSession <- PxfsSession

The IpcSession has:
-user id
-effective acl (when creating storage)

The DpoSession has pointers to stuff like:
-journal
-storage allocator



------------------------

Pregion should be built on top of a sparse storage pool
