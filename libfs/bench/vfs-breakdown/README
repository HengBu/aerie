Microbenchmarks to get a breakdown of where the time is spent in the 
kernel's VFS layer. 

We use the perf profiling utility to get the breakdown. Because perf cannot 
profile specific sections of code, microbenchmarks use perfremote to 
attach/deattach perf to themselves so we profile the specific sections we 
are interested in.

Use scripts/run.sh to run all the microbenchmarks and get a breakdown.
